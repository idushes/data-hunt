## Feature request administration

Set `FEATURE_REQUEST_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` to a comma-separated list of EVM wallet
addresses. Accounts authenticated with any address in this allowlist can move
community requests between `requested`, `planned`, `in_progress`, and
`released`.

Example:

```env
FEATURE_REQUEST_ADMIN_ADDRESSES=0x1234...,0xabcd...
```
